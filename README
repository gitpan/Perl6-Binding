This module creates lexical aliases to items that can be either lexical or
dynamic. For example, after this statement:

    my $foo := $array[2];

both $foo and $array[2] refer to the same value. If you take references to both
items, you'll discover that \$foo eq \$array[2]. Changing either of them changes
the other.

You can also alias entire arrays or hashes:

    my @bar := @$arrayref;
    my %baz := %{$hoh{'element1'}->{'subelement'}};

You can also alias the contents of an array or a hash, or an array or hash
slice.

    my ($foo, @bar, %baz) := *@array;

In the above, $array[1] must be an array reference, and $array[2] must be a hash
reference.

When aliasing the contents of a hash, the names of the aliased variables
determine the hash members that are aliased.  The following two statements have
identical effects.

    my ($foo, @bar, %baz) := *%hash;
    my ($foo, @bar, %baz) := @hash{qw/foo bar baz/};

This version is still an alpha version, released so that I can get some feedback
on bugs and on the general functionality of the module.
